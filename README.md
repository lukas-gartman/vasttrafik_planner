# V채sttrafik Multi-Planner

V채sttrafik Multi-Planner is an alternative to the official V채sttrafik travel planner app built with Flutter. It is currently under development and aims to improve the travel planning experience for public transport users in the Gothenburg area.

## Current Features

### Multi-Stop Search
Plan trips that span multiple nearby stops in a single search. For example, if you're going to Chalmers, you can include both Chalmers and Chalmers Tv채rgata in the same search instead of checking them separately.

### Distance Sorting
Unlike the official app, which often shows distant results before more relevant local ones, this app fixes that by sorting results by distance and also showing how far each stop is from your current location.

### Real-time Journey Tracking
View real-time information about your trip, including delays, estimated departure and arrival times, your current location, the full route, and where the vehicle is on the map.
